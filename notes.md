# TODO

- Make different kinds of "challenge" components and render each based on the type stored in the object. This will allow me to have multiple choice answers, inputs, etc, without having to code the HTML in the admin.

## LEFT OFF

I need to make sure that every time a new user is selected, the context is completely reset. The next thing to do is to implement the stealing functionality
